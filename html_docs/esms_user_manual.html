<h1><a name="esms_user_manual">ESMS User Manual</a></h1>
<p>This document is the official user's manual for the 
ESMS program.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="what_is_esms">What is ESMS</a></h2>
<p>ESMS is an acronym for <strong>E</strong>lectronic <strong>S</strong>occer <strong>M</strong>anagement <strong>S</strong>imulator. It is a program,
or rather a family of programs, that allows people to run fantasy soccer management 
games. Think of a soccer computer game, like Championship Manager, for example. It allows
you to build a team of players and manage them through a soccer league, setting the opening
squad, tactics and formations, substituting players etc. You deal with player injuries,
suspensions, transfers and all the other aspects of soccer team management.</p>
<p>ESMS gives you these abilities, but submits the whole league to your control, and not
the PC's. That means that you decide how your league looks like, what teams play (these
are often completely made-up, fantasy teams, and not copies of real soccer teams), who
are the managers (it can be your friends, or just people from the Internet who want to
play), etc. It's really a wholly another concept, which might be difficult to get used
to unless you know what you want. The best advice I can give at this point is to look at
some existing fantasy leagues online that use ESMS, to get a feel of how these things
work (it is as simple as looking for ``esms soccer league'' or something similar in your
favorite web-search engine).</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="types_of_esms_users">Types of ESMS users</a></h2>
<p>The ESMS users can be roughly divided to two camps:</p>
<ol>
<li></li>
You play, or intend to play, in a ESMS league opened by someone else. Read this document
carefully if it's your first experience with ESMS - it teaches all the basics you need to
play the game.
<p></p>
<li></li>
You plan to create a ESMS league of your own. I warmly recommend some prior ESMS 
experience if you want to do this. There are plenty of active ESMS leagues online - playing
in one teaches a lot about creating one. Anyway, you must the Administrator's manual as well,
but only after you read and fully understand this document.
<p></p></ol>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="license_and_availability">License and availability</a></h2>
<p>Some people believe that the best thing about ESMS is that it's completely free and 
widely available.</p>
<p><strong>Free</strong> - ESMS is open source software: It is free 
to use and distribute, and its source code is freely available. ESMS is licensed 
with the GNU General Public License (GPL) - see GNU's website at <a href="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org</a> for 
more details.</p>
<p><strong>Available</strong> - As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, ESMS's source code is 
free. I distribute the binaries (executables) formally only for Windows, because this is where most of
its users are. But ESMS easily compiles on all Unix platforms, and many people
use it on Linux servers. Additinally, if your native language isn't English, ESMS
has special provision for translators that will make it friendly to your native-language
users. ESMS was translated to Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Lithuanian, Czech, Polish, Swedish
and French by loyal fans, but there may be more translations I'm personally not aware of.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="1._fundamental_concepts">1. Fundamental concepts</a></h1>
<p>The main goal of ESMS is to simulate a game of soccer between two teams: given some textual 
description of the teams - players, tactics, formations and so on, ESMS runs a soccer
simulation and produces textual output 
files that describe the game.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="1.1_anatomy_of_a_soccer_game_in_esms">1.1 Anatomy of a soccer game in ESMS</a></h2>
<p>A team in ESMS is represented by a <strong>roster</strong> - a text file that lists the team's players
with their various abilities/attributes (age, tackling skill, aggression etc.) and 
league status (injured, suspended, fitness level, etc.)</p>
<p>ESMS simulates a soccer game between two teams. Its input for each team is the roster, and 
a <strong>teamsheet</strong> submitted by the team's manager. The teamsheet specifies which players play
in the game in the opening squad, who sits on the bench, what is the tactic/formation, provides
the orders for substitutions and tactic/formation changes, etc.</p>
<p>Given two rosters and two teamsheets for these rosters, ESMS runs a game and reports the 
result in a detailed commentary file that looks somewhat like the textual commentary in
Championship Manager - all the interesting game events are reported sorted by their time
of occurence. The commentary file also summarizes the game, with various team
and player statistics for both teams.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="1.2_rosters_and_players">1.2 Rosters and players</a></h2>
<p>The roster of each team is usually just a text file named xxx.txt where <em>xxx</em> is the 3 letter
abbreviation of a team (team names in ESMS have registered abbreviations, to keep file
names short). It isn't necessary to restrict the abbreviation to 3 letters, but it has proved
to be the most convenient method.</p>
<p>If you look at a roster of a ESMS team (if you have no rosters nearby, see the Administrator's
manual for help on generating rosters), you will see a header and a list of players. The header
and a line for some player look like this:</p>
<pre>
 Name         Age Nat Prs St Tk Ps Sh Sm Ag KAb TAb PAb SAb Gam Sav Ktk Kps Sht Gls Ass  DP Inj Sus Fit
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A_Santiago    20 arg   C  3 15  9  8 35 24 300 320 556 108  11   0  29   9   6   0   1   8   0   0  85</pre>
<p>The structure of a player's description is as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: The player's name. It is advised not to give players names longer than 12 characters. The name
must consist of contiguous non-whitespace characters - spaces in names are forbidden ('_' is frequently used 
instead).</p>
<p><strong>Age</strong>: The player's age.</p>
<p><strong>Nat</strong>: The player's nationality - a 3 letter abbreviation. (In our example, 'arg' represents Argentina).</p>
<p><strong>Prs</strong>: Preferred side - one or more of R (Right), L (Left) and C (Center) that specify where on the field the 
player is most effective. Combinations of these 3 letters signify players who are good on more than one side:
RC, RL, LC and RLC.</p>
<p><strong>St</strong>: Shot stopping skill - how well the player performs between the posts (how good a Goalkeeper he is).</p>
<p><strong>Tk</strong>: Tackling skill - how well the player tackles, important for defensive players.</p>
<p><strong>Ps</strong>: Passing skill - how well the player passes, important for midfield players.</p>
<p><strong>Sh</strong>: Shooting skill - how well the player shoots to goal, important for offensive players.</p>
<p><strong>Sm</strong>: Stamina - how enduring the player is. Players with high stamina get tired less quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Ag</strong>: Aggression - how aggressive the player is.</p>
<p><strong>KAb, TAb, PAb, SAb</strong>: Shot stopping, Tackling, Passing, ShootingAbilities - the player's ability 
in each of the 4 main skills. Read on for more details.</p>
<p>The following are ``statistics'' - they may be reset for each new league season, and in general
represent some ``state'' of the player in the league, opposed to the attributes that stick with
the player.</p>
<p><strong>Gam</strong>: Games - how many games the player played so far in the league.</p>
<p><strong>Sav</strong>: Saves - the amount of saves the player has made while playing as a Goalkeeper.</p>
<p><strong>Ktk</strong>: Key tackles - how many important (goal saving) tackles the player has made.</p>
<p><strong>Kps</strong>: Key passes - how many important (leading to a scoring opportunity) passes the player has made.</p>
<p><strong>Sht</strong>: Shots - how many shots at the opponent's goal the player has made.</p>
<p><strong>Gls</strong>: Goals - how many goals the player has scored.</p>
<p><strong>Ass</strong>: Assisted - how many goals the player has assisted.</p>
<p><strong>DP</strong>: Disciplinary Points - how many disciplinary points has the player accumulated. Read on for more info.</p>
<p><strong>Inj</strong>: Injury - for how many games/weeks is the player currently injured.</p>
<p><strong>Sus</strong>: Suspension - for how many games/weeks is the player currently suspended.</p>
<p><strong>Fit</strong>: Fitness - on a scale of 1 - 100, how fit the player is to play in the next game.</p>
<p>Note the delicate games/weeks issue in injuries and suspensions. ESMS fantasy leagues usually try to
mimic real-world soccer leagues by playing one game per week. However, sometimes cup games are played
in the middle of the week. Injuries are, naturally, specified in time units like weeks, but suspensions
are usually specified in an amount of games.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="1.3_player_positions_and_sides">1.3 Player positions and sides</a></h2>
<p>Unlike in other games, a player in ESMS doesn't have a pre-defined position. A player has a set of skills which
makes him more suitable on some positions than on others - it is up to his manager to decide on which
position to play him. The positions in ESMS are:</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
GK - goalkeeper. The solitary guardian-angel of your team's goal. Players with high St (Shot stopping) 
skills are good GKs.
<p></p>
<li></li>
DF - defender. DFs are the major line of defense of your team. They usually tackle most of the 
opponent's attacks. Players play best as DFs when their Tk (Tackling) skill is high.
<p></p>
<li></li>
DM - defensive midfielder. DMs balance between defense and midfield. They help protect your goal,
but they also take their chances in advancing and feeding the attackers with vital passes.
Players play best as DMs when they have good Tk and Ps (Passing) skills.
<p></p>
<li></li>
MF - midfielder. MFs are the main link between your defense and offense. 
Players with a high Ps skill are good midfielders.
<p></p>
<li></li>
AM - attacking midfielder. AMs are up there in the offense, trying to score goals and support the 
forwards. Players play best as AMs when they have good Ps and Sh (Shooting) skills.
<p></p>
<li></li>
FW - forward. The major fire-power of your team. FW are fed with passes from your midfield and score goals.
Players function best as FWs when their Sh skill is high.
<p></p></ul>
<p>Players also play on different sides of the field. The sides, as you have already seen are Right,
Left and Center. Any player in ESMS can play on any side (just like he can play on any position) but players
will perform much better when playing on their preferred side. When you specify how a player will play in
your teamsheet (see the explanation of teamsheets for more info), you must combine the positions with the 
side (except for the goalkeeper). For example, DML means that the player plays as a left defensive midfielder;
FWC means a central forward, etc. GK is the only player for which the side isn't explicitly specified.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="1.4_team_formation">1.4 Team formation</a></h2>
<p>A team formation is simply a summary of what positions its players play on. It should be familiar from
the real soccer world and computer games. For example 4-4-2 is commonly used to specify that the team
plays with 4 defenders, 4 midfielders and 2 attackers.</p>
<p>In ESMS the formation is implicitly inferred from the positions assigned to all players. You don't specify a 
formation in the teamsheet - you specify the positions your players
play in. Formation can be useful on the league-level, however, to impose certain restrictions on teamsheets.
For example, some leagues forbid to play with more than 5 defenders, or with more than 3 attackers. 
ESMS doesn't mind how you play your players - as long as they're 11 and there's one goalkeeper. You 
can in theory put a team of a GK + 10 left midfielders (MFL), ESMS won't mind, but don't be surprised if your
team won't shine - a healthy balance of defense and offense is required to play well. ESMS was built to mimic reality - what works in reality will work in ESMS as well. Common real-world
formations like 4-4-2, 5-2-3, 3-1-5-2 etc proved to be effective.</p>
<p>Special care has to be given to sides of players. Playing with 4 players in the defense may be solid,
but not quite so if they are all assigned to the Right. Balanced formations perform better than 
unbalanced - for example when you play with 4 players in defense, the balanced formations are LCCR (Left,
two Centers and one Right) and LLRR (two Lefts, two Rights), and so on. The multitude of formations and
side assignments makes it rather tricky to build a really strong team - you will need a good mix of 
players with various skills for each position. An injury of a key player can be quite a challenge to the
manager, that may be forced to change his game-style while this player can't play.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="1.5_team_tactics">1.5 Team tactics</a></h2>
<p>Another issue a manager has to consider is the tactic his team will use in the game. ESMS supports
a variety of tactics - in fact, tactics are fully customizable and can be set by each league for its
own needs. I'll describe the default tactics that come with ESMS - they have been tested by time and
provide an interesting variety.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
Normal (<strong>N</strong>) - The most basic tactics in ESMS (don't be folled by ``basic'' - in some cases N is the most
effective way to play). It provides no special benefits, but also has almost no vulnerabilities. A team
playing N will enjoy a stable mix of defense and offense.
<p></p>
<li></li>
Defensive (<strong>D</strong>) - A team playing D focuses a lot on defense. If you want to keep the score down, giving 
a strong fight in the defense, but also not taking much opportunities in the offense, D is the tactic
for you. With this tactic your midfielders, and even attackers to some extent focus more on the defense,
hence your opponent will have a hard time scoring, but so will you.
<p></p>
<li></li>
Attacking (<strong>A</strong>) - The most offensive tactic. Your team is eager to score - the attackers stick
near to the opponent's goal, the midfielders take a lot of chances and even the defenders join
to help. This all gives good offense, but your defense will suffer greatly.
<p></p>
<li></li>
Passing (<strong>P</strong>) - Your team will push for offense, driving slow but efficient attacks. Naturally, when
a team focuses on attack, the defense is weaker. This tactic is more 
offensive than N but less than A.
<p></p>
<li></li>
Counter Attack (<strong>C</strong>) - The defenders concentrate on defense, but seek opportunities to drive the
midfielders and attackers to stinging counter-attacks. This tactic is more offensive than D but less
than N.
<p></p>
<li></li>
Long Ball (<strong>L</strong>) - The most unusual tactic, which can sometimes be a winner and sometimes fail, depending
on the opponent. With L, your attack is driven by long balls right from the defense, and midfielders play
a minor role. This tactic is usually used by teams with relatively weak midfielders.
<p></p></ul>
<p>In addition, certain tactics have bonuses agains other tactics. This is summarized in the following table:</p>
<pre>
 Tactic  Against  Bonus type
 ---------------------------
 N       -        -
 D       L        Defense
 A       -        -
 P       L        Defense &amp; Offense
 C       A &amp; P    Midfield &amp; Offense
 L       C        Defense &amp; Midfield</pre>
<p>As you can see, the bonuses are quite convoluted. Bonuses are not a provision for victory, of course, but
they make tactic-picking more interesting. Just like in real life, it may help if you have a general
idea of what tactic your opponent is going to use.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="1.6_skills_and_abilities">1.6 Skills and Abilities</a></h2>
<p>As you have already learned, there are four major skills in ESMS - St (Shot stopping), Tk (Tackling),
Ps (Passing) and Sh (Shooting). These skills have the biggest effect on how players play, and on which
positions they perform best. It would be boring, however, if the skills of players were constant 
throughout their career and it wouldn't reflect what happens in real soccer. For this reason, ESMS has 
the concept of Abilities.</p>
<p>An ability is means for a player to improve his skill over time. Each player has an ability rating (a number
between 1 and 1000) for each of the major skills (KAb, TAb, PAb, SAb). The ability is affected by the 
player's performance in each game. If you want to see exactly how the abilities change for each event,
see the Administrator's manual.</p>
<p>Eventually, abilities cause skill increases or decreases. For example, once a certain player's PAb (Passing
ability) reaches 1000, it is reset and his Ps skill raises by one point. The same happens with decreases.
This makes players in ESMS dynamic - they usually improve over time, especially if they perform well - just
like real players do.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="1.7_stamina_and_fitness">1.7 Stamina and Fitness</a></h2>
<ul>
<li></li>
Fitness - while playing, a player gets tired. For each minute he plays, a small amount of fatigue adds
up, and this makes a player generally less effective over time. The difference is not great, but it is
certainly advantageous to substitute players to bring some fresh wind into your team's sails. The players'
fitness rating is a number between 1 and 100 (100 means the player is 100% fit, etc) that tells the
fitness level the player will start his next game with. On each minute he plays, the player's fitness
goes down a little bit, and he ends the game less fit. Between games, some amount of fitness is added to
each player.
<p></p>
<li></li>
Stamina - stamina is a rating between 1 and 100 denoting how endurant a player is. It is a constant rating
that affects how quickly a player loses fitness while playing. A player with stamina 80 will be generally
more fit after a full game than a player with stamina 60.
<p></p></ul>
<p>The meaning of Fitness and Stamina in ESMS is quite simple - players get tired and should get some rest
from time to time. Your league can set its own rules about fitness recovery (see the Administrator's 
manual), but generally it is desired to keep an eye on your players' fitness. Sometimes it is better
to play a lower-skilled player with fitness 100 than a higher-skilled player who is very tired and
has fitness 50.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="1.8_aggression">1.8 Aggression</a></h2>
<p>Each player in ESMS plays aggressively to a certain degree. Aggression is a constant rating between 1 and 
100. A more aggressive player will sometimes perform better (because he's so eager and has a lot of motivation
to win balls), but will usually commit more fouls.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="1.9_fouls,_cards_and_dps">1.9 Fouls, Cards and DPs</a></h2>
<p>Players in ESMS commit fouls, that may lead to them getting (yellow or red) cards, and sometimes causes
penalties. ESMS doesn't keep count of all the fouls - only of the most serious ones, which at least
deserve a warning from the referee. The amount of disciplinary points of each player accumulates and
for a certain amount of points he will be suspended for one game or more. For the exact workings of 
this mechanism, consult the Administrator's manual.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="1.10_substitutions">1.10 Substitutions</a></h2>
<p>ESMS supports a configurable amount of players on the bench and of the amount of substitutions allowed.
The default is what currently seems to be the norm in European soccer leagues - 7 players listed on the 
bench, and 3 substitutions allowed per game.</p>
<p>The game engine itself performs automatic substitutions in certain occasions - when someone gets injured
for instance - to replace the injured player with a substitute player from the bench. Additionally, if the
team's Goalkeeper gets injured or suspended (by a red card), ESMS will look for a way to substitute him
for another GK, or (if your team has done all 3 substitutions) move another player to play as a GK.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="1.11_home_bonus">1.11 Home bonus</a></h2>
<p>Just like in real life, teams playing at their home stadium have a little advantage over the guests.
They know the field better, the crowd is supportive, etc. ESMS takes this into account and a certain
bonus is given to home teams, that is, everything else being equal (equal skills of players, formations
and tactics) a home team has a slightly higher chance to win. The exact amount of the bonus, like most
of the things in ESMS is configurable, and each league can decide on its favorite bonus.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="2._teamsheets">2. Teamsheets</a></h1>
<p>Teamsheets are a way for the manager to control the game of his team. This section explains in detail 
what one should write in the teamsheet and how the teamsheet file should be structured.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="2.1_structure_of_a_teamsheet">2.1 Structure of a teamsheet</a></h2>
<p>A manager submits a teamsheet for his team before each game - where he lists the players that 
will play and various orders for his team to execute during the game. Here is a good place to
emphasize that games in ESMS are off-line, the manager gives all his commands <em>before</em> the game
and sees the results after it ends. There's no way to intervene during a game. This aspect is 
essential to the nature of ESMS - administrators usually run all the games at once, without 
intervention from the managers (otherwise it would just be a logistic mess).</p>
<p>Below is a template teamsheet, with explanations of what each field means. Lines starting with
``//'' are comments for clarification, and should not appear in real teamsheets.</p>
<pre>
 [Team name]           
 [Tactic]
 
 // Opening squad - a mandatory goalkeeper and 10 other players
 
 GK    [Name]   
 [Pos] [Name]          
 [Pos] [Name]     
 [Pos] [Name] 
 [Pos] [Name]

 // The substitutes (here I use the default amount 7)
 
 [Pos] [Name]          
 [Pos] [Name]         
 [Pos] [Name]
 [Pos] [Name]
 [Pos] [Name]
 [Pos] [Name]
 [Pos] [Name]
 
 PK: [Name]
 
 // Orders...
 
 [Action] IF [Condition] 
 [Action] IF [Condition]   
 ...
 ...</pre>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="2.2_team_name">2.2 Team name</a></h2>
<p>The 3 letter abbreviation of your team. This tells ESMS what roster represents your team.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="2.3_tactic">2.3 Tactic</a></h2>
<p>The tactic your team starts the game with. You can give orders to change the tactic later
in the game.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="2.4_opening_squad">2.4 Opening squad</a></h2>
<p>List of the 11 players that start the game and their positions. The first player must
be the team goalkeeper, and there can only be one goalkeeper. [Name] is simply the player's
name from the roster, and [POS] is his 3 letter position - for example DFL, AMC...</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="2.5_substitutes">2.5 Substitutes</a></h2>
<p>The players on the bench (I use here the ESMS default of 7 subs). Position should also
be specified for these players, as it will help ESMS in its automatic substitutions. If
your defender gets injured, you'd want ESMS to substitute another defender for it, rather
than a forward.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="2.6_penalty_kick_taker">2.6 Penalty kick taker</a></h2>
<p>The primary penalty shooter of your team. If this player gets injured/suspended/substituted,
ESMS will find another player to take the shots.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="2.7_player_numbering">2.7 Player numbering</a></h2>
<p>After you've specified all your team's players for the game, you can refer to them in the 
orders by their numbers. The numbers start with 1 for the goalkeeper and up to the last
sub. For example, 11 is the last player in the opening squad, 12 is the first sub, and so on.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="2.8_orders">2.8 Orders</a></h2>
<p>This is, by far, the trickiest part of the teamsheet. Orders are given in a mini-language that
tells ESMS what to do and when. Each order consists of an action (what to do) and a group of
conditions (when to do it). ESMS will execute an order if all the conditions for it are satisfied.
The actions in ESMS are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_tactic_%5bnew_tactic%5d">TACTIC [new tactic]</a></strong><br />
</li>
Orders ESMS to change your team's tactic to [new tactic].
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_changepos_%5bname%2fnumber%2fposition%5d_%5bnew_po">CHANGEPOS [name/number/position] [new position]</a></strong><br />
</li>
Tells ESMS to change the position of a certain player. You can refer to a player by his name, number or by a position. If a position is specified, ESMS finds the worst player on this position (worst - meaning
with the lowest relevant skill, for example Ps for midfielders).
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_sub_%5bname%2fnumber%2fposition_out%5d_%5bname%2fn">SUB [name/number/position out] [name/number in] [new position]</a></strong><br />
</li>
Substitutes a player. Takes a name, number or a position of a player to take out, just like CHANGEPOS. Additionally,
takes the name or number of a player to bring in, and the position he'll play.
<p></p></ul>
<p>The actions are still not full order lines, which should also include at least one condition. In general,
several conditions can be given, separated by commas. The conditions in ESMS are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="item_if_min_%5bsign%5d_%5bminute%5d">IF MIN [sign] [minute]</a></strong><br />
</li>
If the game is now before, at, or after a certain minute. The allowed signs are =, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;= and &gt;= with
their usual mathematical meanings.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_if_score_%5bsign%5d_%5bscore%5d">IF SCORE [sign] [score]</a></strong><br />
</li>
Specifies the goal difference between your team and the opponent's team. A positive goal 
difference means you lead, a
negative means the opponent leads. For example 2 means you lead by 2 goals (e.g. the score is 2-0, 3-1,
4-2 and so on). Similarly, -2 means that you lose by 2 goals. The sign has the same meaning as in the MIN condition.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_if_yellow_%5bposition%2fname%2fnumber%5d">IF YELLOW [position/name/number]</a></strong><br />
</li>
If the player got a yellow card. If a position is given, any player on this position counts.
That is, for MFC - if any central midfielder got a yellow card.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_if_red_%5bposition%2fname%2fnumber%5d">IF RED [position/name/number]</a></strong><br />
</li>
Similar to the previous condition, but with a red and not a yellow card.
<p></p>
<li><strong><a name="item_if_inj_%5bposition%2fname%2fnumber%5d">IF INJ [position/name/number]</a></strong><br />
</li>
Similar to the previous condition, but with an injury instead of a card.
<p></p></ul>
<p>To make things clearer, here are some sample orders with explanations:</p>
<pre>
 TACTIC A IF MIN &gt;= 45, SCORE =&lt; -1</pre>
<p>Tells the program to change the tactic to attacking if it 
is later than the 45th minute and your team is losing by one or more goals.</p>
<pre>
 TACTIC A IF MIN =&gt; 45, SCORE =&lt; -1, SCORE &gt; -4</pre>
<p>Tells the program to change the tactic to attacking if it 
is later than the 45th minute and your team is losing by one or more, but 
less than 4 goals.</p>
<pre>
 CHANGEPOS J_Doe MFC IF MIN &lt;= 20, SCORE &gt;= 1</pre>
<p>Changes the position of J_Doe to MFC if it's earlier than the 20th minute and your
team leads by one goal or more.</p>
<pre>
 SUB MFC 12 DFC IF MIN = 60, SCORE =&gt; 1</pre>
<p>Substitutes the worst MFC of your team for player 12 (that will play DFC) if you are leading
by one goal or more on the 60th minute.</p>
<pre>
 CHANGEPOS FWC MFC IF RED MFC, MIN &gt;= 50</pre>
<p>Changes the position of the worst FWC of your team to MFC if some MFC got a red card after
the 50th minute.</p>

<p>This document teaches you the basics of ESMS. But it won't make you an ESMS expert - that
takes some time an experience. You are cordially invited to read the Administrator's manual, that will
give you knowledge of how to actually run ESMS leagues, and will teach you about certain ESMS concepts
in depth.</p>
<p>The best way to get acquainted with the program and get a feel for how it works is to
experiment. Each user, even a manager who only participates in games, is encouraged to
run some test matches with ESMS. It is very easy, if you read the Administrator's manual,
and can add greatly to your understanding of ESMS. Besides, it's usually a lot of fun
to make up teams and teamsheets and see them clash !</p>

<h2><a name="3.3_some_history">3.3 Some history</a></h2>
<p>ESMS was initially created by myself (Eli Bendersky) and Igor Oks. We started our soccer 
play-by-email journey in 1998, as managers in a fantasy league called WWISL, which used spreadsheets 
to 'run' games. This was extremely cumbersome and time consuming, and the league fell apart shorty 
after starting. However, the people who participated in WWISL were left with the feeling that this 
kind of a game may be successful. Shortly after the WWISL fell apart, together with David Austin 
(another ex-WWISL player) we teamed up to create a new play-by-email league, calling it the Global 
Internet Soccer League (GISL). The GISL used a program named MSWL, which was created by Allan Sellers, 
to run its games and had 30 participants (team managers). GISL went through all the difficult phases 
of a start-up league, but managed to survive, and ran very successfully for 3 full seasons (a bit 
longer than a calendar year) with MSWL. Over that time, the league developed some unique needs and 
features that weren't covered by MSWL, and were handled manually.</p>
<p>This is about the time when we 
decided to create a program of our own, which will both answer the unique needs developed in GISL 
and be an improvement of MSWL. We took our time during a break we had in our University studies 
and in about a month created the basic skeleton of ESMS. It then took a couple of months of much 
less intensive work to create the final form of the main (game running) program and the other 
components, and ESMS was released in early 1999.</p>
<p>For the record, the first official ESMS game was run on April 10th, 1999, in a test league we arranged 
with some friends to test the program. The GISL started to use it almost immediately after release, 
and it didn't take much time for other leagues to pop-up using this program. Today, ESMS is widely used in dozens of 
leagues, by thousands of managers from all over the world.</p>
