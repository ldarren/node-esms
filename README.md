A word about this source code:

ESMS was initially written together with a friend as our first real software project. We learned C while writing it, and frankly, this shows on parts of the code. So, the initial version was quite a lopsided lump of C - which nevertheless worked and did its job admirably. In later incarnations, when I rewrote and added features, I switched to C++ and tried to make the code cleaner, adhering to real programming practices. So the source code is a mash-up of older C code and newer C++ code.

Compiling:

All the source code compiles with any ANSI C++ compiler. Use the makefiles to see how to compile it.
